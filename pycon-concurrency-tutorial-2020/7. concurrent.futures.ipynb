    "\n",

    "#### Executors\n",
    "Executors are the entry points of `cf`. They are similar to `multiprocessing.Pool`s. Once an executor has been instantiated, we can `submit` jobs, or even `map` tasks, similar to `multiprocessin.Pool.map`. `concurrent.futures.Executor` is an abstract class. `cf` includes two concrete classes: `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ProcessPoolExecutor`. This means that we can keep the same interface, but use completely different mechanisms just by changing the executor type we're using:"
